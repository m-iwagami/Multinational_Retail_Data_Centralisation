# Multinational_Retail_Data_Centralisation

## Project Introduction
This project is from a multinational company that sells various goods across the globe. Currently, their sales data is spread across many different data sources making it not easily accessible or analysable by current members of the team. In an effort to become more data-driven, making its sales data accessible from one centralised location helps their work. Producing a system that stores the current company data in a database so that it's accessed from one centralised location and acts as a single source of truth for sales data. Querying the database to get up-to-date metrics for the business is the goal of the project.
